Kolla Images Support Matrix
===========================

This page describes the supported base container image distributions and
versions, and the Kolla images supported on each of those.

Supported base images
=====================

The following base container images are supported:

================== =============================== ================
Distribution       Default base                    Default base tag
================== =============================== ================
Rocky Linux        quay.io/rockylinux/rockylinux   9
Debian Bullseye    debian                          bullseye
Ubuntu Jammy       ubuntu                          22.04
Ubuntu Noble       ubuntu                          24.04
================== =============================== ================

.. note::
   In order to build Ubuntu Noble based images ``base_tag`` needs to be set
   to ``24.04`` (if using a local image from your own registry - the tag needs
   to at least start with 24.04, e.g. '24.04-my-version')

The remainder of this document outlines which images are supported on which of
these distribution.

Support clause definitions

T - Tested
----------

Coverage:

* CI in ``kolla-ansible`` is testing that images are functional
* kolla core team is maintaining versions

U - Untested
------------

Coverage:

* CI in ``kolla-ansible`` is *NOT* testing that images are functional
* Many untested services are working fine, but the kolla core team cannot
  guarantee that they are all functional

N - Not Available/Unknown
-------------------------

Not available *(e.g. not buildable)*.
