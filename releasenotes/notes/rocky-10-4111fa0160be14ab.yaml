    Adds support for Rocky Linux 10 as a base container image. From the 2025.2
    release onward, Rocky Linux 10 is the only supported Rocky Linux major version.
upgrade:
  - |
    Rocky Linux 9 is no longer supported as a base container image, so
    deployments using Rocky Linux should migrate to Rocky Linux 10.
  - |
    The ``telegraf`` image relied on Rocky Linux 9-only packages and is therefore
    unavailable for Rocky Linux-based builds.
