    Fixed missing metrics in Prometheus libvirt exporter.

    The Prometheus libvirt exporter has been bumped from ``v1.6.0`` to
    ``v2.2.0``. This restores some metrics that were lost when the exporter
    source was changed in a previous release.

    `LP#2120639 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/2120639>`__.
