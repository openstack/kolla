# Kolla options
###################
# Valid options are [ COPY_ONCE, COPY_ALWAYS ]
#config_strategy: "COPY_ONCE"

# Valid options are [ centos, fedora, oraclelinux, ubuntu ]
#kolla_base_distro: "centos"

# Valid options are [ binary, source ]
#kolla_install_type: "binary"

# This should be a VIP, an unused IP on your network that will float between
# the hosts running keepalived for high-availibility. When running an All-In-One
# without haproxy and keepalived, this should be the first IP on your
# 'network_interface' as set in the Networking section below.
kolla_internal_address: "10.10.10.254"

# The Public address used to communicate with Openstack as set in the public_url
# for the endpoints that will be created. It defaults to kolla_internal_address
# but can be overridden in your globals.yml to a public address. It is up to the
# deployer to ensure that that public address maps to the environment correctly.
# It is recommended to use a DNS name as well, but not required.
#kolla_external_address: "{{ kolla_internal_address }}"

# Docker options
####################
### Example: Private repository with authentication
#
# docker_registry: "172.16.0.10:5000"
# docker_namespace: "companyname"
# docker_registry_username: "sam"
# docker_registry_password: "correcthorsebatterystaple"
# docker_insecure_registry: "False"

# The default behaviour when running the playbooks is to pull the latest image
# available when running the playbooks. If a newer image is found, it will pull
# that new image and recreate the containers. If this is not the behaviour you
# want, this should be set to 'missing'
# Valid options are [ always, missing ]
#docker_pull_policy: "always"


####################
# Networking options
####################
# This interface is what all your api services will be bound to by default.
# Additionally, all vxlan/tunnel and storage network traffic will go over this
# interface by default. This interface must contain an IPv4 address.
network_interface: "eth0"

# These can be adjusted for even more customization. The default is the same as
# the 'network_interface'. These interfaces must container an IPv4 address.
#api_interface: "{{ network_interface }}"
#storage_interface: "{{ network_interface }}"
#tunnel_interface: "{{ network_interface }}"

# This is the raw interface given to neutron as its external network port. Even
# though an IP address can exist on this interface, it will be unusable in most
# configurations. It is recommended this interface not be configured with any IP
# addresses for that reason.
neutron_external_interface: "eth1"

# Valid options are [ openvswitch, linuxbridge ]
#neutron_plugin_agent: "openvswitch"


####################
# OpenStack options
####################
# This option is used to specify the tag to use when pulling the Docker images
#openstack_release: "latest"

# Use these options to set the various log levels across all OpenStack projects

#openstack_logging_debug: "False"

# OpenStack services can be enabled or disabled with these options

###################
# Ceph options
###################
# mandatory if enable_ceph=no and cinder_volume_driver or glance_volume_driver is set to "ceph"
#ceph_mon_hosts: "host1, host2"

# Ceph can be setup with a caching to improve performance. To use the cache you
# must provide seperate disks than those for the OSDs
# ceph_use_cache: "no"
# Valid options are [ forward, none, writeback ]
# ceph_cache_mode: writeback

# A requirement for using the erasure-coded pools is you must setup a cache tier
# Valid options are [ erasure, replicated ]
# ceph_pool_type: "replicated"
