The Kolla project is a member of the OpenStack `Big Tent
Governance <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/projects/index.html>`__.

Kolla's mission statement is:

::

    To provide production-ready containers and deployment tools for operating
    OpenStack clouds.

Kolla provides `Docker <https://docker.com/>`__ containers,
`Ansible <https://ansible.com/>`__ playbooks to deploy OpenStack on baremetal
or virtual machine to meet Kolla's mission.

Kolla has out of the box defaults for a working basic deployment, and also
implements complete customization. This model permits operators with minimal
experience to deploy OpenStack quickly and as the operator's experience grows
modify the OpenStack configuration to suit the operator's exact requirements.

Getting Started
===============

Learn about Kolla by reading the documentation online
`Kolla <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla/latest/>`__.

Get started by reading the `Kolla Ansible Developer
Quickstart <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/user/quickstart.html>`__.

The Kolla Repository
====================

The Kolla repository is one of three deliverables of the OpenStack Kolla
project. The three deliverables that make up the Kolla project are:

The `Docker images <https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/>`__
are built by the Kolla project maintainers. A detailed process for
contributing to the images can be found in the `image building
guide <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla/latest/admin/image-building.html>`__.

The Kolla developers build images in the `kolla` namespace for every tagged
release.

You can view the available images on `Docker Hub
<https://hub.docker.com/u/kolla/>`__ or with the Docker CLI::

    $ sudo docker search kolla
