    Debian Trixie container images require the additional
    qemu-system-modules-spice operating system package for SPICE consoles
    to function correctly. This package has therefore been added
    to the nova-libvirt container build. Further details are available in
    the bug report at `LP#2138186 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/2138186>`__.
