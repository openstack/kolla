    Fixes incremental MariaDB backups by switching to directory-based base backups,
    following official Mariabackup recommendations.

upgrade:
  - |
    Backup files are now stored in timestamped directories and have new filenames.
    This does not affect restore, as Kolla Ansible does not support automated restore;
    users perform restores manually. A new full backup is recommended after upgrade
    to ensure incremental backups work correctly.
