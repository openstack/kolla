features:
  - |
    Adds configuration option ``use_dumb_init``, with default value of
    ``True``. This can be use to avoid the of ``dumb-init`` as the
    container entrypoint,
    using ``kolla_start`` directly instead. This option can also be disabled
    via the ``kolla-build --nouse-dumb-init`` CLI argument.
upgrade:
  - |
    Moves the ``ENTRYPOINT`` statement outside of the
    ``dumb_init_installation`` Jinja block in the base image. Overriding this
    block to install ``dumb-init`` by another method no longer requires
    repeating the ``ENTRYPOINT`` statement. Users wishing to avoid the use of
    ``dumb-init`` altogether can now use the ``use_dumb_init`` configuration
    option.
