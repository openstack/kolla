    # NOTE(gmann): We are using this generic template for python version
    # testing. When a new development cycle starts, we need to do two things:
    # 1. Update this template for the python version jobs as per the
    #    new development cycle tetsing runtime defined by TC
    #    https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/runtimes/
    #    Use the 'branches' variant to run the applicable python version
    #    jobs.
    # 2. Make sure the previous cycle applicable jobs continue to run for
    #    the new stable branch. Use the 'branches' variant to run the
    #    applicable python version jobs.
