upgrade:
  - |
    The ``fluentd`` image no longer includes the ``kubernetes_metadata_filter``
    plugin. It is not used by Kolla downstream projects (Kolla-Ansible,
    TripleO, OpenStack-Helm). It can be installed by customizing
    ``fluentd_packages``.
deprecations:
  - |
    Kubernetes-related images are deprecated and will be removed in
    the Ussuri cycle. They are not used by Kolla downstream projects
    (Kolla-Ansible, TripleO, OpenStack-Helm). They were used in the
    Kolla-Kubernetes project which was retired in the Rocky cycle.
    The deprecated images include: ``helm-repository``, ``kube-*``,
    ``kubernetes-entrypoint`` and ``kubetoolbox``.
    The ``install_kubectl`` macro is deprecated as well and, along with it,
    the ``magnum-conductor`` image's ``kubectl`` command because it is of
    limited usefulness being pinned to an old version. Magnum end-users use
    an externally-provided ``kubectl``.
    Please note this deprecation does not affect Magnum nor Qinling support.
