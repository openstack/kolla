Kolla Overview
==============

The Kolla project is part of the OpenStack [TripleO][] effort, focused
on deploying OpenStack services using [Docker][] containers. The initial
system [spec][] provides additional details of Kolla and the use cases
it addresses.

Getting Started
===============

Deployment on bare metal is a complex topic which is beyond the scope of
the project at this time. An environment to simplify the deployment of a
single or multi-node Kolla cluster is required for development purposes.
As a result, a [Heat template][] has been created for deploying a Kolla
cluster to an existing OpenStack cloud.

Docker Images
-------------

The [Docker images][] are built by the Kolla project maintainers. A detailed
process for contributing to the images can be found [here][]. Images reside
in the Docker Hub [Kollaglue repo][].

[Docker images]: https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerimages/
[Kollaglue repo]: https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/kollaglue/

The Kolla developers build images in the kollaglue namespace for the following
services:
* Glance
* Heat
* Keystone
* Mariadb
* Nova
* Rabbitmq
* Neutron
* Mongodb
* Ceilometer
* Zaqar
* Horizon

```
$ sudo docker search kollaglue
```
A list of the upstream built docker images will be shown.

Directories
===========

* docker - contains artifacts for use with docker build to build appropriate
  images
* compose - contains the docker-compose files defining the container sets
* tools - contains different tools for interacting with Kolla
* devenv - A collection of tools and resources for managing a Kolla
  development environment.
