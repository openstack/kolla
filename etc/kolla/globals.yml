# Kolla options
###################
# Valid options are [ COPY_ONCE, COPY_ALWAYS ]
#config_strategy: "COPY_ALWAYS"

# Valid options are [ centos, fedora, oraclelinux, ubuntu ]
#kolla_base_distro: "centos"

# Valid options are [ binary, source ]
#kolla_install_type: "binary"

# Valid option is Docker repository tag
#openstack_release: "1.1.0"

# This should be a VIP, an unused IP on your network that will float between
# the hosts running keepalived for high-availability. When running an All-In-One
# without haproxy and keepalived, this should be the first IP on your
# 'network_interface' as set in the Networking section below.
kolla_internal_vip_address: "10.10.10.254"

# This is the DNS name that maps to the kolla_internal_vip_address VIP. By
# default it is the same as kolla_internal_vip_address.
#kolla_internal_fqdn: "{{ kolla_internal_vip_address }}"

# This should be a VIP, an unused IP on your network that will float between
# the hosts running keepalived for high-availability. It defaults to the
# kolla_internal_vip_address, allowing internal and external communication to
# share the same address.  Specify a kolla_external_vip_address to separate
# internal and external requests between two VIPs.
#kolla_external_vip_address: "{{ kolla_internal_vip_address }}"

# The Public address used to communicate with OpenStack as set in the public_url
# for the endpoints that will be created. This DNS name should map to
# kolla_external_vip_address.
#kolla_external_fqdn: "{{ kolla_external_vip_address }}"

# Docker options
####################
### Example: Private repository with authentication

#docker_registry: "172.16.0.10:4000"
#docker_namespace: "companyname"
#docker_registry_username: "sam"
#docker_registry_password: "correcthorsebatterystaple"


####################
# Networking options
####################
# This interface is what all your api services will be bound to by default.
# Additionally, all vxlan/tunnel and storage network traffic will go over this
# interface by default. This interface must contain an IPv4 address.
network_interface: "eth0"

# These can be adjusted for even more customization. The default is the same as
# the 'network_interface'. These interfaces must container an IPv4 address.
#kolla_external_vip_interface: "{{ network_interface }}"
#api_interface: "{{ network_interface }}"
#storage_interface: "{{ network_interface }}"
#tunnel_interface: "{{ network_interface }}"

# This is the raw interface given to neutron as its external network port. Even
# though an IP address can exist on this interface, it will be unusable in most
# configurations. It is recommended this interface not be configured with any IP
# addresses for that reason.
neutron_external_interface: "eth1"

# Valid options are [ openvswitch, linuxbridge ]
#neutron_plugin_agent: "openvswitch"


####################
# keepalived options
####################
# Arbitary unique number from 0..255
#keepalived_virtual_router_id: "51"


####################
# TLS options
####################
# To provide encryption and authentication on the kolla_external_vip_interface,
# TLS can be enabled.  When TLS is enabled, certificates must be provided to
# allow clients to perform authentication.
#kolla_enable_tls_external: "no"
#kolla_external_fqdn_cert: "{{ node_config_directory }}/certificates/haproxy.pem"


####################
# OpenStack options

# Use these options to set the various log levels across all OpenStack projects
# Valid options are [ True, False ]
#openstack_logging_debug: "False"

# Valid options are [ novnc, spice ]
#nova_console: "novnc"

# OpenStack services can be enabled or disabled with these options

###################
# Ceph options
###################
# Ceph can be setup with a caching to improve performance. To use the cache you
# must provide separate disks than those for the OSDs
#ceph_enable_cache: "no"
# Valid options are [ forward, none, writeback ]
#ceph_cache_mode: "writeback"

# A requirement for using the erasure-coded pools is you must setup a cache tier
# Valid options are [ erasure, replicated ]

# Manila - Shared File Systems Options
#######################################
#manila_enable_dhss: "yes"


##################################
# Swift - Object Storage Options
##################################
# Swift expects block devices to be available for storage. Two types of storage
# are supported: 1 - storage device with a special partition name and filesystem
# label, 2 - unpartitioned disk  with a filesystem. The label of this filesystem
# is used to detect the disk which Swift will be using.

# Swift support two mathcing modes, valid options are [ prefix, strict ]
#swift_devices_match_mode: "strict"

# This parameter defines matching pattern: if "strict" mode was selected,
# for swift_devices_match_mode then swift_device_name should specify the name of
# the special swift partition for example: "KOLLA_SWIFT_DATA", if "prefix" mode was
# selected then swift_devices_name should specify a pattern which would match to
# filesystems' labels prepared for swift.
#swift_devices_name: "KOLLA_SWIFT_DATA"
