upgrade:
  - |
    The neutron-vpnaas-agent has been loaded just inside of the existing
    l3 agent rather than requiring operators to run a completely different
    binary with a subclass of the existing L3 agent.

deprecations:
  - |
    As neutron-vpnaas-agent can be loaded by the neutron l3 agent,
    neutron-vpnaas standalone mode is not supported. It's time to
    remove this container.
